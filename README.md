# nodejs-demo-app
# Node.js CI/CD Pipeline with Docker and GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of a Node.js web application using a CI/CD pipeline built with **GitHub Actions** and **Docker**.

## 🚀 What This Does

Every time you push code to the `main` branch:

1. The app is automatically **built** using Docker.
2. The Docker image is **tagged** and pushed to **DockerHub**.
3. All of this happens through a **GitHub Actions workflow**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Node.js**: Sample web application.
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates the CI/CD process.
- **DockerHub**: Stores the built Docker images.
